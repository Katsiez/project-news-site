Houm Magazine / An online magazine featuring lifestyle inspiration
The Houm Magazine is a pretend online catalogue that features lifestyle inspiration. Through a range of mock-up rticles and images borrowed from https://www.pexels.com, the aim is to inspire with articles on how to create the most enjoyable living, woring and relaxing space in the comfort of your home. Viewers are encouraged to browse through the online catalogue for insights and inspiration.

## The problem

To build this News Site / Online magazine, I used flexbox combined with some Bootstrap in order to achieve responsive columns, navbar and overall a responsive website which works well on almost all devices. Prior to creating this website, I drew a scetch with an idea of how I'd like it to look however, after finding inspiration at: https://www.thesitemagazine.com/thesitemagazine, I decided to create clean, minimalistic and neutral look with content organized in columns.

If i had more time, I would have most definately spent some time creating paragraphs that match the content of the website, I would have also toned down on the ambition to include even the tiny bit of details on design and would have instead focused primarily on the structure of the website, instead of so much on the design/layout.
